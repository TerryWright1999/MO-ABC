# MO-ABC
Approximate Bayesian Computing with automatic selection of summary statistics. The idea is that you want to make posterior estimates on some parameters. You have a huge number of summary statistics which might be related to the parameters in question. Genetic Programming is used to find the best combination of subsets. That is subsets with the lease entropy and at the same time are short and so do not introduce extra noise. A Pareto Front of possible subsets are created. ABC is performed with each subset.
